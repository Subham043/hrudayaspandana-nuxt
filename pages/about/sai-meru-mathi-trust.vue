                            <p>Temples in India were (and still are) not merely architectural marvels of breath-taking
                                beauty, but also specialized structures designed for very specific purposes like

                                diseases. Gigantic temples were sometimes carved from a single piece of rock as blocks

                                pieced together at other times like a giant jigsaw puzzle to build the temples, often

                            <p>Essence of scriptures is “madhava seva” – it is to guide mankind along the right path for
                                creating a protected and prosperous world. This seva inculcates dharmic values in the
                                people,
                                their families and bring them together to further aim of unity – “Vasudeva kutumbam”.

                                Hrudaya Spandana is attempting to serve the world to protect, preserve and propagate
                                sanathana dharma, rising above caste, class and language barriers. It is believed that
                                this
                                helps people to bring about an inner transformation.
                                Rudrabhishekam, homas and devatha kalyanams have a profound effect on the environment
                                and
                                people attending it. These vibrations purify the surroundings and calming effect on the
                                people’s mind. These can be well compared to meditation/yoga. The experience of oneness
                                of
                                the worshipper with the worshipped is realization of true nature of the self. These
                                pujas,
                                celestial weddings, homas are carried out for the welfare of the world. These
                                incantations
                                generate protective, healing and pleasant vibrations that charge the environment with
                                positive energy.
                                A true devotee never thinks of himself. He is so full of the thought of God that his own
                                self is forgotten. That is the best way to attain salvation.
